# The-Diplomacist

## Description
Created this app as a favour for a friend who was running https://diplomacist.com at the time. Since no one has been active on the site for a while, development was halted a while back. I just updated the project so it will work on iOS 11.4.

Currently, the app fetches all the articles on the home page of the website and displays them. You can also open an article to read it. Thats all the functionality the app has because developement was halted very early.

## To run:
1. Open The Diplomacist.xcworkspace workspace with XCode.
2. Select iOS version <= 11.4
3. Build and Run

## Notes
- The program was recently updated to work with Swift 4.0+
